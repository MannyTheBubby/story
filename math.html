    <h1 class="middle">You choose to go to math class.</h1>
    <p class="center">Good morning class, the teacher says. The teacher says that you will be having lunch early. Very odd, as this has never happened before. When you go to the cafeteria with your friends, you realize that there is no food in the cafeteria. This is very strange you think. This has never happened before to you. Suddenly, a warning pop ups on the screen in the cafeteria. Warning Zombie Outbreak. Stay inside and away from the infected. Every gets scared and the teacher tells you to stay calm. Outside the window, you see a zombie outside the classroom. What do you do?</p>
