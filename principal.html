    <h1 class="middle">You choose to tell the principal.</h1>
    <p class="center">The principal thinks that this is all nonsense and decides to send you to detention. He sentences you to 4 hours of detention. Once in there, he locks the door and tells you to be quiet until he comes and gets you. You start panicking but the principal doesn’t care. After the 4 hours is over, he doesn’t come since he’s been eaten by the zombies. You can’t leave. Eventually the zombies come in and you die.</p>
