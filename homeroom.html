    <p class="center">Good morning class, the teacher says. I hope my sunshine students are having a good day. Everything in this class proceeds normally and you and your friends have a good time studying and reviewing notes. Suddenly, the announcement turns on and it calls for the teacher to go to the office. Confused, the teacher goes to the office and comes back. She tells everyone that there is a dangerous situation. A zombie apocalypse has started. You will need to hide. What do you go?</p>
