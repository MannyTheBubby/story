    <p class="center">You continue to hide in the kitchen. You can hear that there are 3 zombies right next to you outside the fridge that you are hiding in. After half an hour, the zombies are gone and you start to move a bit. However, since your muscles hurt so much, you accidentally make a sound. The zombies come and you start screaming. You die.</p>
