    <p class="center">You go back into the cafeteria and decide to hide in the kitchen. You hope that the zombies donâ€™t see you and you see many of them pass by you and your friends. As the number starts increasing, you have to make a choice. You can hide and hope that everything is fine or you can make a run for the basement. You can either stay in the kitchen or hide.</p>
